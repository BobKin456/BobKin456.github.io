  <h1>New Anthem?</h1>
  <p>Focus on the lyrics, no need to get in your feels, just think about it as you helping a friend practice, this is for kicks and giggles.....maybe :)</p>
  <p>My Prediction is that the words match but the melody doesn't hit like "For Tonight" and "Love in the Dark", but you'll let me know</p>
